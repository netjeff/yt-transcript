# YouTube transcript: Copy to clipboard

## What

Copies the following to clipboard:
- Page title & url
- Transcript of the youtube video.

## Why

I'd like to be able to use my favorite AI chatbot(s) to ask questions about YouTube videos.  

But fully integrating different AI chatbot(s) to summarize from transcript is a lot of work.

So I use this extension to copy the transcript to clipboard, and then I can simply paste into any AI chatbot to ask for summary, or other questions.

## How

I've not yet published this to addons.mozilla.org.  So you have to install "manually"

1. Download/clone this to your local computer

1. Open Firefox and enter this in the url bar:
 `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.

1. This will bring up a new tab.  Click "Load Temporary Add-on..." 

1. Select the `manifest.json` file.

You'll have to load this as Temporary every time you start Firefox.   Once I get this published to addons.mozilla.org, you will be able to get it there.
